# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This script implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Features

*   **Encryption:** Encrypts a given text using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift value.
*   **Decryption:** Decrypts ciphertext back to plaintext using the same shift value (or its inverse).
*   **Handles Uppercase and Lowercase:** Preserves the case of letters during encryption and decryption.
*   **Preserves Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) are left unchanged.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts the user for input (text, shift value, encryption/decryption choice).

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   No external libraries are required.

## Usage

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `caesar_cipher.py`).
2.  Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python3 caesar_cipher.py
